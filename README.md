# sklearn-machine-learning-model-generator
#### this is only for Classification Tasks in Machine Learning
this class will help you to create sklearn ML model
## requirements
- data for training as panda Dataframe
- data for testing as panda Dataframe
- what you want to predict

what this class do for you
- optimize train and test data
- gives you a trained model for prediction

# Upcoming
- if you want to predict more that a data
- Auto generated train and test set
    - it will take all the columns names where each value has a significance and you don't want to disturb the ratio of number of occurrences of the each value of such columns to make the model more efficient [like gender], then the model will generate train and test set in such a way that the ratio of number of occurrences of each value of such columns remains almost same in both the sets
    - Example :-  if main dataset have data of 38% Male and 62% Female, then both test and train set will have data of almost 38% Male and 62% Female
## How to use

```bash
  I have given jupyter notebook for tutorial
